# Phase 3 Project: Baby Logbook

This is an application that allows a user to log baby's milestones and daily records. A user can add baby's milestones, doctor appointments, and immunization records to keep track of them. 

This application was created with a react front end and a ruby and sinatra back end.

## Background
