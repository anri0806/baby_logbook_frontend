# Phase 3 Project: Baby Logbook

This is an application that allows a user to log baby's milestones and daily records. A user can add baby's milestones, doctor appointments, and immunization records to keep track of them. 

This application was created with a react front end and a ruby and sinatra back end.

## Background

I am a mother of 1 year old daughter and I have been using baby tracker app to track her daily records such as sleep time, feeding, milestones etc.  This app was really helpful as a first time mom so I decided to create something similar for my Phase 3 project.


## Features
